# Fluid Simulation
Fluid simulation on C++ with CUDA and SFML 

You need Cuda Toolkit compiler and SFML library to build project
- Cuda Toolkit: https://developer.nvidia.com/accelerated-computing-toolkit
- SFML library: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
- CUDA code located in kernel.cu file
- SFML window renderer located in Source.cpp

This is a free-time individual project and you can use code from this repository for any of your needs.

Original algorithm was described in GPU Gems book 1, chapter 38: http://developer.download.nvidia.com/books/HTML/gpugems/gpugems_ch38.html

this repository is created for an article on habr.com: https://habr.com/ru/post/470742/
